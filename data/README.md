## Climate data
The climate data is used as the input of a case study from 2033 to 2043 in the Texas region, utilizing atmosphere temperature, relative humidity, and dew point at 2-meter height, wind speed at 100-meter and direct and net solar radiation flux at surface obtained.

## Grid data
We obtain the layout and size information of individual loads from a 2,000-bus synthetic Texas grid due to the lack of high-resolution real load data. This information includes longitude, latitude, and active power. In addition, we calculate the share of individual loads in their respective load zones based on their active power and total power in the load zones to obtain a more detailed understanding of the distribution of loads in the region.

## ERCOT data
- We collect historical zonal load data between 2018 and 2022 from ERCOT.
- We collect zonal load datlong-term load forecast between 2023 and 2032 from ERCOT.
- We collect historical planned generation capacity outage data from ERCOT, which provides hourly planned capacity outage of intermittent (wind and solar) and non-intermittent (thermal and hydro) resources, respectively.

## Weather data
We collect historical weather data at 203 Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) sites throughout Texas, which contains temperature, dew point, relative humidity, and wind speed, where we average and interpolate to unify into hourly data.
